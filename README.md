# <Module 1: Horiseon Marketing Agency>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

## What was your motivation?
    -My motivation for this project was a commission from the Horiseon Marketing Agency to create a website for the their company. The front page of the site offers an organized and eye-catching page containing explanations and benefits of the most important concepts about their services. This front page offers the most important information about their services to potential customers, who can then go more in depth about their services with links at the top of the webpage to other pages.

## Why did you build this project? 
    -This project was completed as an exercise in reading, understanding, and in some sense reverse-engineering the inner workings of an example webpage, including its HTML and CSS style sheet. Comments were added to the classes in the CSS as a way to measure understanding of the subject. Furthermore, it was an exercise in refactory work. While leaving functionality the same, my goal was cleaning up the codebase and adjusting for readability, leaving comments for understanding for other developers or even my future self.

## What problem does it solve?
    The webpage serves as a website for the company that can be found through a google search, offering services in search engine optimization, reputation management, and social media marketing. It explains what these concepts are, their significance in today's market, and the benefits to using the Horiseon Marketing Agency to reap the benefits of their services. Links are given to redirect the user to pages that go more in depth on search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. These links in this particular project redirect the user to youtube because there are no other pages.

## What did you learn?
    A stylish and therefore effective webpage does not have to be extremely complicated. I will admit that It would take me a long time to build a clone of the site from scratch by myself, but I understand everything here. An ugly website could cause frustration and even demonstrate to a potential customer a lack of care that could reflect on the quality of their service.
